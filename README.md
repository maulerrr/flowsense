# FlowSense: Microservices-Based Intelligent Traffic Incident Detection

**FlowSense** is a framework for demonstrating the advantages of microservices in traffic incident detection and response. It compares the performance of an event-driven microservices architecture with a traditional monolithic system. FlowSense utilizes real-time data processing, anomaly detection, and machine learning models to analyze traffic patterns and manage incidents efficiently.

## Features
- **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture**: Each microservice is responsible for a specific function such as data collection, anomaly detection, incident detection, and response management.
- **Monolithic System**: A traditional single-block architecture for comparison with microservices.
- **Kafka Event Streaming**: Handles asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects traffic irregularities based on speed and other factors.
- **Incident Classification**: Classifies incidents such as accidents using basic rules or machine learning models.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure system response time, latency, and incident detection accuracy in both architectures.

## Key Metrics
FlowSense measures and compares the following performance metrics between microservices and monolithic architectures:
1. **System Response Time** (in milliseconds): How quickly the system detects and responds to incidents.
2. **Latency** (in milliseconds): The time delay between receiving traffic data and processing it.
3. **Incident Detection Accuracy**: Accuracy of detecting incidents such as accidents or traffic congestion (e.g., false positives/negatives).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowsense.git
cd flowsense
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the microservices using Docker Compose
Ensure Docker is installed, then run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will launch all the microservices (data collection, anomaly detection, incident detection, and response management) and Kafka for event streaming.

### 4. Running the Monolithic System
To run the traditional monolithic system for performance comparison:
```bash
python monolithic/traffic_management_system.py
```

### 5. Monitor performance
The performance metrics will be logged to the `performance_results/` folder for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for microservices and monolithic systems.
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming platform for microservices communication.
- **Docker**: For containerizing microservices and managing deployment.
- **Machine Learning**: Models for traffic incident detection (optional).

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced machine learning models (e.g., CNNs for image-based incident detection, anomaly detection models).
- Add predictive analytics microservice for forecasting traffic incidents.
- Scale the system with real-time traffic data from APIs or publicly available datasets.
